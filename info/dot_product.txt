*** Dot Products ***

For vectors A and B

A = [a1, a2, a3, ... an]   B = [b1, b2, b3, ... bn]

the dot product is defined as

A * B = [a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3 + ... anbn]

where the dot product is not defined for vectors of different length.
The dot product also satisfies the equation

A * B = |A||B|cos(theta)

where theta is the angle between the two vectors.
One can consider the dot product as a special case of more general matrix multiplication.
