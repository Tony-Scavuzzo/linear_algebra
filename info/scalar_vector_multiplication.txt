*** Scalar Vector Multiplication ***

The multiplication of a vector A

A = [a1, a2, a3, ... an]

by a scalar b is defined as

bA = [ba1, ba2, ba3, ... ban]

Scalar-Vector multiplication is associative e.g. b(cA) = (bc)A
Scalar-Vector multiplication is commutative e.g. bA = Ab
Scalar-Vector multiplication is distributive e.g. (b+c)A = bA + cA and c(A + B) = cA + cB

Scalar-Vector multiplication can be conceptualized as transforming vector A by elongating it by a factor of b.
If b is negative, it reverses the direction of A and also multiplies its length by a factor of |b|.
