*** Matrix Transpose ***

The Transpose T of an nxm matrix A is defined as

       [a11 a12 a13 ... a1m]       [a11 a21 a31 ... an1]
       [a21 a22 a23 ... a2m]       [a12 b22 b32 ... an2]
T(A) = [a31 a32 a33 ... a3m]   =   [a13 a23 a33 ... an3]
       [ .   .   .  ...  . ]       [ .   .   .  ...  . ]
       [an1 an2 an3 ... anm]       [a1m a2m a3m ... anm]

Note that this transforms an nxm matrix into an mxn matrix.
This operation is used as an intermediate step in many important operations.
